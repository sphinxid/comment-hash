This completes the WordPress plugin implementation. The plugin provides:

- A proof-of-work system for comment submission using SHA-256
- A clean, modern loading animation during verification
- Configurable settings for secret key and time window
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Detailed error handling and user feedback

To install:

- Create a directory named comment-hash in your WordPress plugins directory
- Place all the files in their respective directories as shown in the structure above

- Configure the settings in Settings -> Comment Hash

The plugin will automatically:

- Generate a secure random 64-character secret key on installation
